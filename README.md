# Category and Subcategory Assignment

This project is an assignment to create a system for managing categories and subcategories using a one-table design in
the database. The system should include a main categories select box, with unlimited subcategories of the parent
category (up to 3 levels deep). The system should use Ajax to dynamically update the select boxes as categories and
subcategories are selected.

## Requirements  


Use any framework to create the project from scratch (such as Laravel, CodeIgniter, etc.).
Use a one-table design in the database to store all categories and subcategories.
Implement a main categories select box, with unlimited subcategories of the parent category (up to 3 levels deep).
Use Ajax to dynamically update the select boxes as categories and subcategories are selected.

## Scoring

The project will be scored on the following aspects:

DB design and implementation
Architecture and code (preferably using the MVC pattern)
Security measures
Use of Ajax
Use of Git for version control

## Example

Here is an example of how the system should work:

Select Category B from the main categories select box.
A new select box appears with SUB B1 and SUB B2.
Select SUB B2 from the new select box.
A new select box appears with

```
SUB SUB B2-1
 ```

and

```
SUB SUB B2-2.
```
